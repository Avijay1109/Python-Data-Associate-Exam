        <h1>Python Data Associate Certification</h1>
        <p>I recently took an exam as part of my journey to earn the <strong>Python Data Associate</strong> certification from <strong>Datacamp</strong>. This certification assesses Python programming skills, particularly in data manipulation and analysis.</p>
        <p>The exam included several practical tasks, one of which involved data cleaning and processing using <code>pandas</code>. These tasks were part of a subjective assignment to demonstrate proficiency in handling real-world data challenges.</p>
        <p>Successfully completing this certification will validate my Python skills and enhance my ability to work with data efficiently.</p>
